# Vim Mode Leds
All you need to turn your next neovim coding session into a strobo party.

The project consists of a Neovim plugin, a PCB with an ATtiny85 microcontroller, code for the ATtiny and a 3D-printable housing for the PCB.
## Housing

The housing is designed to be printed with an 0.4mm nozzle. Supports are only
needed for the USB plug thickener of the base.

## PCB

The PCB should have a thickness of 1.6mm, so that together with the housing the USB plug has a total thickness of ~2.2mm.
This lets it fit snugly into a USB port.
